# So, what is this?

Several months ago, I sent out a series of FOIA requests to jails and prisons around the country to get data on how people interact while detained and how that affects various psychological and economic outcomes. What came out of that was a series of datasets detailing the 24-hour location of several thousand detainees at the Cook County Jail in Illinois. I think there are some important insights to be gleaned from this data, but it is quite complex: think hierarchical panel data with arbitrary entry and exit. The complexity comes from structural facts about life in jail -- people move cell assignments a lot; people move back and forth between court and medical care frequently; infractions are frequent, and few days are without incident.

Unfortunately, I don’t anticipate having time to give this data the attention it deserves and at this point it's practically collecting dust on my computer. My sense is there’s a ton of insight to be gleaned, so I’m making the data publicly available here. Message me if you’d like to collaborate on something, but also feel free to do something solo and run with it. All I ask is if you make use of the data, try to be a good steward: give credit to the Cook County Sheriff's Office and think about ways to make jail a little less atrocious.

Example questions that are likely answerable with this data (with some disciplined statistics):

* How much more dangerous is it to pair cell mates of different races?

* Do people become more or less violent over the course of their time in jail?

* Do people behave differently before and after their court appearances?

* How long do people spend in jail before their first court appearance? Does this differ by age or other demographics?

* How much time do people spend in medical care while in jail?

* [Potentially many more I haven’t thought of…]
